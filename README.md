# SoundPrinter

**SoundPrinter** is an experimental project aimed at creating a **sound replicator** using **TypeScript**. It leverages **Next.js** for the web-based UI, providing an interactive experience for users to analyze, synthesize, and replicate sounds.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎵 **Sound Analysis** – Capture and analyze sound frequencies, amplitudes, and patterns.
- 🔊 **Sound Synthesis** – Generate and manipulate sound waves programmatically.
- 🌐 **Web-Based UI** – Built with Next.js for a modern, responsive interface.
- ⚡ **Fast & Efficient** – Optimized for performance using Web Audio API and modern TypeScript practices.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Audio Processing:** Web Audio API, Tone.js
- **State Management:** Zustand / Redux (TBD)
- **UI Components:** Tailwind CSS, Radix UI

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Nu11ified/soundprinter.git
cd soundprinter

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to explore the app.

## 📖 Usage

1. **Record or Upload a Sound** – Use the UI to record live audio or upload a file.
2. **Analyze the Sound** – View frequency spectrums, waveform visualizations, and other metrics.
3. **Modify & Synthesize** – Apply transformations and effects to recreate or alter the sound.
4. **Export & Share** – Save the replicated sound for further use.

## 🔥 Roadmap

- [ ] Implement basic sound visualization.
- [ ] Add real-time sound modification tools.
- [ ] Introduce AI-assisted sound replication.
- [ ] Enhance UI with more controls and visual feedback.
